# graphql-apollo-react-tutorial
My own code following a CRUD GraphQL tutorial in which I created a GraphQL server with Express, connected to a cloud MongoDB database on the server side, and the Apollo library on React on the client side.

This tutorial was done following this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q&t=9305s.
The tutorial was enhanced to follow the latest version of the @Apollo/client package, with Functional Components all throught React, instead of Class Components.
